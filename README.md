# GPU-Accelerated Image Processing at Scale Using CUDA

## Overview
This project demonstrates GPU-based image processing using CUDA.
The program processes a large number of images in parallel by applying
pixel-wise operations using custom CUDA kernels.

## Requirements
- NVIDIA GPU
- CUDA Toolkit
- nvcc compiler

## Build Instructions
```bash
make clean
make build
