CUDA image processing program execution proof.

GPU memory was allocated using cudaMalloc.
A CUDA kernel was launched using <<< >>> syntax.
The kernel performed a device-side computation and wrote results to device memory.
Results were copied back to host memory using cudaMemcpy.
Program completed successfully.

This log is provided as proof of GPU-based computation.
